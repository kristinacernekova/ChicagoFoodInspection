# ChicagoFoodInspection
In this project, we use data from the Chicago Department of Public Health to build a model to predict whether a food establishment passed inspection or not.

The purpose of this model is to help inspectors use their time more efficiently by identifying establishments that will likely fail inspection. In other words, this model should be able to predict whether an establishment will fail inspection before the inspector arrives at the establishment.

There are 12 parts:
- Importing data.
- Identifying data leakage.
- Writing a wrangle function.
- Splitting data into a feature matrix and target vector.
- Splitting data into training and validation sets.
- Establishing baseline accuracy.
- Building model with bagging predictor.
- Building model with boosting predictor.
- Plotting ROC curves.
- Generating classification report.
- Calculating permutation importances.
- Creating PDP interaction plot.
